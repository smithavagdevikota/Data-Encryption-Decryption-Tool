# 🔐 Data Encryption & Decryption Tool (Web App)

This is a modern and user-friendly web application that provides **text and file encryption/decryption** using two basic cryptographic techniques: **Caesar Cipher** and **XOR Cipher**.  
The tool is built using **HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript**, and works fully inside the browser without needing any server.

## 🚀 Features
- ✨ Modern UI with animations (Lottie + TailwindCSS)
- 🔑 Supports two encryption methods:
  - **Caesar Cipher** (Shift-based encryption)
  - **XOR Cipher** (Bitwise encryption)
- 📝 Encrypt & decrypt **text messages**
- 📁 Encrypt & decrypt **files**
- ⚡ Fully client-side — no data is uploaded anywhere
- 🎨 Smooth fade animations for clean user experience
